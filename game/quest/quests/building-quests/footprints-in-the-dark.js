I quickly gather a couple of sturdy men and went out to check it. Arriving at the lumbermill we found broken axes, planks, and the main saw being gone. We have no idea who did it as the perpetrators were already gone by the time we got there.'\n\nYou follow him to the area and start investigating the Lumbermill. It is indeed in tatters, clearly showing signs of a focused attack to hinder the production. There are a mix of large footprints from the lumberjacks in the nearby area, but there are also some smaller and lighter footprints.\n\n**You are presented with __two__ choices:**\n```diff\nChoice 1:\n- Blame the lumberjacks for sabotaging the production to get some vacation.
